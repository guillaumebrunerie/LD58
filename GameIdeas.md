== Collector ==

Rover in a desert, need to choose wisely which parts to get. For instance
battery, plugs, accumulators, better wheels, metal detector, shovel, better vision.

In a city, you are a cop, collect wanted suspects. You are in a car (or on
foot), there are many people around, you need to go next to them to find the
suspect. You can collect spare parts to upgrade your car.


You control a dog, you need to collect sheep. The sheep are dumb, they just
basically follow you, so if you need to go get a sheep that escaped you need to
move your dog there but then all other sheep will follow you.

Tax collector, you need to go from house to house to collect taxes. The more
taxes, the more collectors you can hire. Or maybe some people don’t want to pay
taxes and they attack you, so you need to hire body guards first.

You need to collect various mechanical spare parts that can be combined to give
you various objects. You have only a limited inventory, so you need to choose
wisely which parts you collect so that you can open doors/kill enemies/etc in
order to get more parts, so that in the end you collected everything.
